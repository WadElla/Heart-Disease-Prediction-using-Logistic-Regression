# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
Healthcare expenditures are overwhelming national and corporate budgets due to asymptomatic diseases including cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, there is an urgent need for early detection and treatment of such diseases. Machine learning is one of the trending technologies which used in many spheres around the world including healthcare industry for predicting diseases. The aim of this study was to identify the most significant predictors of heart diseases and predicting the overall risks by using logistic regression. Thus, binary logistic model which is one of the classification algorithms in machine learning was used in this study to identify the predicators. Further, data analysis was carried out in Python using JupyterLab in order to validate the logistic regression.
